// Data Types in JavaScript:
// 1. String: Represents text. Example: "Hello, World!"
let email = "albert@gmail.com"
// 2. Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example: 42, 3.14
let score =  65.8
// 3. Boolean: Represents true or false values. Example: true, false
let isLoggedIn = false
// 4. Object: Represents complex data structures. Example: {name: "Alice", age: 30}
let user = {name: "Alice", age: 30}
// 5. Array/List: Represents a list of values. Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry",90,[1,2,3], ["matatu", "bodaboda"]]
// 6. Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. Example: let x;
let x;
// 7. Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. Example: let y = null;
let age = null;
// 8. Symbol: Represents a unique identifier. Example: let sym = Symbol("id");

// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The type is determined at runtime based on the assigned value.

email = 89 // email is now a number
